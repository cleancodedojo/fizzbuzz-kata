# FizzBuzz Kata

## Level
* Beginner

## Skills
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Open Closed Principle (OCP)

## Instructions
* 1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* 2. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
* 3. For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.. 
* 4. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Additional Instructions
* 1. When you've got it all working for "Fizz" and "Buzz", add "Whizz" for 
  multiples of seven
* 2. Add "Fizz" also for all numbers containing a 3 (eg 23, 53)

## Retrospective
* Is the code you have written clean? Are there any smells?
* Did you refactor throughout or do it all at the end?
* What if a new requirement came along that multiples of seven were "Whizz"? 
  Could you add that without editing the existing code? 
  (Cue discussion of the Open Closed Principle)
